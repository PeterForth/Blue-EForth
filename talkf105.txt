Source file that I load with Win32Forth on a PC. I use this
program to bootstrap the EForth into the STM32 chip. It
was originally written for the STM32F105 so you'll see
F105 used in a lot of names. It works fine for the
STM32F103 chip as well. This file was created for my own
use and has a bunch of other things in it for my own use
and debugging the loading and running of EForth. It is not very
clean and only provided in case one doesn't have a method
of loading the EForth.hex file. Please excuse the sloppy
coding.
If you wish to write you own loader, on another platform,
please refer to the STM documentation, as I have.
It communicates with the typical FTDI 5V/3.3V USB to serial.
It could communicate with a normal serial as well but you'd
need a level converter to 3.3V from RS232 levels.
I connect 4 wires from the FTDI board to the Blue Pill (BP).
GND to GND
5V to 5V (I suspect one could do 3.3V to 3.3V instead)
FTDI TX to pin A9 of the BP
FTDI RX to pin A10 of the BP
configure the FTDI for 3.3V output signals

To download the EForth into the BP

1. copy the *.hex file to EForth.hex (I use a fixed name here)
2. set the boot0 jumper to 1 on the BP and boot1 to 0
3. connect USB cable, FTDI and BP to the PC. 
4. hit reset button on BP
5. from pc, 'SS (enter)' 
6. If you've configured the serial port correctly, the BP
should return "Ack". If not check to see that you are
actually communicating with the serial. My FTDI board has
a LED indicator. There is some setup of the FTDI on the PC
to connect a serial channel to the USB but it was so long
ago, I've forgotten it all.
7. from pc 'unProtRd (enter)' , it should reply "Ack"
8. hit reset button on BP ( it shouldn't need this but for
some reason some chips do need a hard reset.
9. 'SS (enter)' again to get Ack
10. from pc 'unProtWr (enter)', should get Ack
11. hit reset switch, on BP again and 'SS' (enter)'
12. from PC, '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 EM (enter)'
you should get Acks. This erases the flash ready to load
EForth. The F103 is 1K blocks. 9 is the number of blocks 
13. from pc  'DownLoad (enter)', A stream of Acks indicates
it is loading the file EForth.hex
14. When done type 'TALK (enter)' then move the boot0 jumper
to zero. Hit the reset button one more time and you should
see the EForth sign on. Used upper case for EFORTH, as it
is case sensitive.
15. To return to the PC use the 'esc' key.
16. to load a Forth source file to the BP, be at the PC and
type 'loadf105 FileName (enter)' the source file should then
load. Enjoy.
